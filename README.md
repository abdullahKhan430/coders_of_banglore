You ask Sam Altman for a 2.2 billion USD in funding and he makes fun of you in public
He asks you where you live and finally after talking to you, gives you a challenging task 

Collect raw instagram data of all openai followers

Answer these questions:

- Who has maximum posts
- who has maximum followers 
- Who follows maximum people 
- How many categories (Digital creators, Non profit foundation etc do we have) of how many people do we have?
